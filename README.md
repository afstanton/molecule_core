This package is intended to handle data structures for chemistry software. It by itself will not provide much direct functionality, but will be used by other packages that do things like calculate energy potentials, read or write data in various formats, or visualize chemicals.

## Features

Right now this is just a placeholder for future development.

## Getting started

Documentation will be added as this fills out.

## Usage

There are no suitable examples on how to use this yet.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

At present, this is a placeholder that other packages will reference, and functionality will be added to this as needed. Once it becomes useful, suggestions will be welcome.
