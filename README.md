This package is intended to handle data structures for chemistry software. It by itself will not provide much direct functionality, but will be used by other packages that do things like calculate energy potentials, read or write data in various formats, or visualize chemicals.

## Features

Right now this is just a placeholder for future development.

## Getting started

Documentation will be added as this fills out.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
